# Quantum Exploration

This repository contains Jupyter notebook demos of basic quantum algorithms using Qiskit:

- **Bell States:** Preparation, statevector printout, and 50/50 histograms for all four Bell pairs.  
- **GHZ State:** 3-qubit entanglement demo with histogram.  
- **Grover’s Search:** 2-qubit search for \|11⟩ with oracle and diffusion operator.  
- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT):** 2-qubit QFT on the state \|01⟩ with measurement histogram.  

## Notebook

- **quantum_demos.ipynb**  
  All code cells for Bell, GHZ, Grover, and QFT, complete with inline plots and statevector outputs.

## Requirements

```bash
!pip install --upgrade qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib
